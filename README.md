# RefChall2023
Welcome to the Referee Challlenge 2023 GitHub repository! This repository contains data and model files related to phone camera data, flipped phone camera data, and filtered synthetic data videos created with Unity. It also includes model files for Movenet and data created using OpenPose.

## Video Data

The data is organized into the following folders:

- [Phone Camera Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Djf08R4_V_pmfwGo8ArrQP0Fh2_QT-L-?usp=sharing): This folder contains phone camera data captured for the our project.

- [Filtered Synthetic Data Videos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UrIsa4aTwmriCEGGBAUuCYwvyMIwRHoU?usp=sharing): This folder contains filtered synthetic data videos that were created using Unity.
- [Nao video's](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QDIIl79lVmP6LSYIN92a7_ZuIUEZBuBS?usp=sharing): This folder contains the dataset we filmed on the NAO V6 robots

## Model Files

The model files for Movenet and OpenPose can be found in the following folder:

- [Model Files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17rzZSiDrDhjIR0rv9Bt9Om3X43PPH-y-?usp=sharing): This folder contains the model files required to use Movenet. Additionally, you will find data created using OpenPose in the subfolder "OpenPose". Also other .npy files for our skeleton data can be found here. The folder 'padding' is the best working version using Movenet Thunder.

To use OpenposeCNN, you can clone the [Lightweight Openpose](https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch) repository and follow the instructions provided. Place the `OpenposeCNN.py` script in the main folder of the cloned repository.

# RefChall2023
Welcome to the RefChall2023 GitHub repository! This repository contains data and model files related to phone camera data, flipped phone camera data, and filtered synthetic data videos created with Unity. It also includes model files for Movenet and data created using OpenPose.

## Data

The data is organized into the following folders:

- [Phone Camera Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Djf08R4_V_pmfwGo8ArrQP0Fh2_QT-L-?usp=sharing): This folder contains phone camera data captured for the RefChall2023 project.

- [Flipped Phone Camera Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ahcp1RxnblwFw12lzUhCCg2Rh9MJ-CUt?usp=sharing): This folder contains flipped phone camera data, which can be used for specific purposes in the RefChall2023 project.

- [Filtered Synthetic Data Videos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UrIsa4aTwmriCEGGBAUuCYwvyMIwRHoU?usp=sharing): This folder contains filtered synthetic data videos that were created using Unity.

## Model Files

The model files for Movenet and OpenPose can be found in the following folder:

- [Model Files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17rzZSiDrDhjIR0rv9Bt9Om3X43PPH-y-?usp=sharing): This folder contains the model files required to use Movenet. Additionally, you will find data created using OpenPose in the subfolder "OpenPose."

To use OpenposeCNN, you can clone the [lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch](https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch) repository and follow the instructions provided. Place the `video.py` script in the main folder of the cloned repository.

## How to Use
